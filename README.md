# Geometric eigenmode null modeling

Code repository looking at geometric eigenmodes, and running some null modeling tests, in response to Peng et al. 2023, Nature. 

External code required, including the openly available code release by Peng et al. and the BrainSpace toolbox. Both are included as sub-repos here. Other external code can be found in `fcn/external`. Special shoutout to [numerical tours](https://github.com/gpeyre/numerical-tours) for great mesh processing tutorials and info. 

External data required -- checkout the folder `osf_dl` for the link to the data.
